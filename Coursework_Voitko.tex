In this article, we’ll take a look at five approaches to tackle common coding problems in a senior way instead of a junior one. Each coding problem is derived from an AoC puzzle, with many problems recurring multiple times throughout AoC and other coding challenges and assessments you might encounter e.g. in job interviews.
